# Three-Tier Docker Application

## Overview

This project aims to develop a secure, efficient, and easily maintainable containerized environment using Docker, specifically designed for a Go application. The architecture employs industry best practices, including a multi-stage Dockerfile to optimize the Go application's deployment, secure credential management, HTTPS communication setup, and seamless container orchestration.

We need to build an three tier application (backend,Database,proxy) with docker principles.


	- The backend docker file write in multi-stage approach.
	- The database creadential is in your host machine.
	- Make sure that proxy is up and running in https protocol and the configuration files is in your host machine.

## output

**To build the docker-compose file** use `docker-compose build`
```bash
